# FII_TIC


This project is a collaboration between UpTogether/FII and the Harvard eval team. The code in this repository is used to 
a) host code written by the eval team that UpTogether/FII can then use to pull data from Ania's Qualtrics account to remind people to complete the survey and pay them when they do;
b) collaborate in analysis across the eval team members.
